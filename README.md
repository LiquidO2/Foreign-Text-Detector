# Foreign-Text-Detector

This is written purely out of personal need. This is still WIP and needs several optimizations. But for now this works for my purpose.

If you want to check it out, I recommend that you wait a few more days and I will add a few more optimizations, tidy up my code and add a little more info.

But if you can not wait, then here is the things you require to run this

- Python 3.x
- [Language Detector](https://github.com/detectlanguage/detectlanguage-python) module
- Get an API key to use this module from  [https://detectlanguage.com/](https://detectlanguage.com/) 
- Put your text in "input.txt" file
- Output will be on "output.txt" file
